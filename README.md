## Rules in game
- Rr specifies the range (r is from 1 to 500 in Golly and LifeViewer; 1 to 10 in MCell).
- Cc specifies the number of states (c is from 0 to 255 in Golly, LifeViewer and MCell)
- Mm specifies if the middle cell is included in the neighborhood count (m is 0 or 1).
- Ss min..smax specifies the count limits for a state 1 cell to survive.
- Bb min..bmax specifies the count limits for a dead cell to become a birth.
- Nn specifies the extended neighborhood type. MCell only supports Moore and von Neumann. Cannot be omitted.
